# Google-Playstore-Case-Study

> the Google Play Store team is working on a feature that will allow them to highlight the most promising apps. This analysis would now necessitate a basic understanding of the characteristics that make a high-performing app. You might pose questions like the following:

- Does an app being larger or more expensive inevitably indicate that it will perform better than the others?
- Is it true that a bigger number of instals indicates which app will get a higher rating than others?

You performed the above analysis for the Reviews, Size, and Installs columns, and along with the box plot, you decided to keep only certain records for analysis.
